# The-VBA-of-Wall-Street

For this project, I designed a program that iterates through stock data to produce clear reporting that delivers information on stock pricing. Leveraging the power of VBA, I was able to iterate through each worksheet and produce the ticker symbol, stock volume, percentage of change, and the open and close price for each stock. 

This program also returns tht stock with the greatest amount of increase or decrease and the greatest total volume. 

Enjoy!
